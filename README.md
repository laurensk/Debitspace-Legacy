# Debitspace

## About Debitspace
Debitspace is an open-source accounting software made for education.

When Debitspace is done, students can easily create workspaces to accomplish various exercises and tasks in the accounting subject. Each workspace contains an entries list which makes it easy to add, edit and delete entries as well as an account table for each account created in a workspace.

Every workspace is stored in a client-side database and can easily be exported as a JSON-file to save your workspace even when you're switching to another computer or come back later.
Exported workspaces can be imported back to Debitspace using the JSON-Importer as well as processed in third-party apps to enable even more features.

You don't have to create an account or log-in in order to use Debitspace and all of its features. Since Debitspace is an open-source project, everyone is gladly invited to develop new features for this accounting software made for education!

## Technology behind Debitspace
Debitspace is completely developed using the Angular framework and the used stylesheet format is CSS.
